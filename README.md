# Facebook_Project-finlatics
An unsupervised machine learning project on Facebook Marketplace post data. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering (KMeans), and PCA-based visualization to analyze user engagement through reactions, comments, shares, and post types.
This project performs unsupervised clustering on Facebook Marketplace post data to uncover patterns in user engagement (likes, comments, shares). Using KMeans and PCA, we analyze how different post types perform and group similar posts based on interaction metrics.

Key features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature extraction (hour, day, month from timestamp)

Correlation analysis & visualization

KMeans clustering with Elbow method & PCA visualization

Engagement insights by post type

ðŸš€ Built using Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn & Matplotlib.
